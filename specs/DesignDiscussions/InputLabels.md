# Input/Label Associations

This document covers design considerations related to issue [#203](https://github.com/microsoft/AdaptiveCards/issues/203).

Consider the following card:
```json
{
	"type": "AdaptiveCard",
	"version": "1.0",
	"body": [
		{
			"type": "TextBlock",
			"text": "Please enter your name:"
		},
		{
			"type": "Input.Text",
			"id": "nameInput",
 			"placeholder": "Last, First"
		}
	],
	"actions": [
		{
			"type": "Action.Submit",
			"title": "OK"
		}
	]
}
```

![img](assets/InputLabels/InputCard.png)

In that card, the label for the input is “Please enter your name:”, however the card renderer has no way to determine that this is the case. We’ve run into a few cases where this is an issue:
 - Accessibility: The input will be read by screen readers as “Last, First”, rather than “Please enter your name” making it more difficult for screen reader users to use the card. 

 - Validation indicators: As part of input validation, we are allowing card authors to mark inputs as optional or required. One way to indicate that visually would be to put an indicator next to the input’s label. This requires knowing which text is the label.

 - Interaction model: Many forms move focus to the input when the label is clicked/tapped on. We can’t support that behavior without knowing which label goes with which input.

 - Responsiveness: One direction for the future of cards involves re-flowing the layout of a card based on the size of the display. Knowing that a particular label goes with a particular input may help us ensure that semantically related elements stay together on reflow.

## Basic Label Support in Adaptive Cards

The basic addition that we are going to make to the schema is to add a label property to all input types. This approach provides a simple and concise way to label inputs, that hopefully encourages card authors to use it and receive the benefits of improvements to the issues called out above.

``` json
{
	"type": "AdaptiveCard",
	"version": "1.0",
	"body": [
		{
			"type": "Input.Text",
			"id": "nameInput",
			"label": "Please enter your name:",
			"placeholder": "Last, First"
		}
	],
	"actions": [
		{
			"type": "Action.Submit",
			"title": "OK"
		}
	]
}
```

## Formatting
The above approach provides a simple means by which to specify the label, but doesn't immediately provide the ability to format the label. Card authors today who are using TextBlocks or RichTextBlocks as labels have the ability to set any of our formatting properties to control the size, color, font weight, etc. of their text. The schema proposed above does not give them that flexibility. One option to address this would be to allow card authors to specify a TextBlock or a RichTextBlock as a label in addition to supporting a simple string.

There is another concern, however, which must be balanced against the desire to provide card authors with the ability to format their labels. Hosts may have label formatting in their app which they want to apply consistently to cards they are displaying. This applies particularly to how they mark fields as required or optional (per spec at [InputValidation.md](https://github.com/microsoft/AdaptiveCards/blob/master/specs/DesignDiscussions/InputValidation.md)). While by default we will mark required inputs with a `*`, we may want to allow hosts more control. Perhaps some apps wish to show labels for required inputs in bold or italics. If we allows hosts to specify formatting based on what is required, however, and we allow authors to specify formatting via a TextBlock or RichTextBlock, we can easily run into cases where the formatting comes into conflict.

This conflict speaks to a general tension inherent in the design of Adaptive Cards. There's always going to be a trade off between giving the author more power, and letting the host control the experience for their users. We need to determine what balance we want to strike in this case.

In order to gather more data to help us balance the needs of the card authors and hosts, we sent a survey to customers who have expressed an interest in improving out input story. The survey sent included 10 questions including the topics of input validation and input labels, for this spec we will only review the 4 questions that focus on the former topic. The results for this questions were used to leverage on some of the decisions taken on this spec document and can be found in the [Appendix](Appendix).

### Default rendering for labels

Reviewing the results from Q8 of the survey, we can see that most voters usually have a good experience with the default rendering of a TextBlock for rendering a label. From this result we can decide that string label rendering should be performed as if we were rendering a default TextBlock.

This would allow authors to emulate writing a simple TextBlock element by simply defining the label as a string, making the string version look like this
```json
{
	"type": "Input.Text",
	"id": "textInput",
	"label": "Label for Input"
}
```

While the same rendering experience using a TextBlock would look like this
```json
{
	"type": "Input.Text",
	"id": "textInput",
	"label": {
		"type": "TextBlock",
		"text": "Label for Input"
	}
}
```

Both of the afore mentioned cards would produce the same rendered result that would look like  this:
 
![img](assets/InputLabels/LabelDefault.PNG)

It is important to note that wrapping should always be performed for this type of labels as not doing so would provide a bad user experience. If users can't read the whole label for an input they may not be able to provide a correct answer.

While it's been mentioned that we'll render a string label as a default TextBlock we should take control of the wrap property to be always set to true. This measure will allow authors and users to have a better experience using labels.

### Host Formatting

Based on the results from Q9 of the survey, we will provide the option to allow the host to control formatting of the labels, either in general or for required inputs, we need a way for them to specify the desired format. There are two main things we may want to include:

#### Text formatting
 We are introducing the option to specify formatting of input labels for required and optional inputs. We will allow full text formatting (as in the formatting properties of a TextBlock) For example:

 ```json
"inputs": 
{
	"label": 
	{
		"inputSpacing": "small",
		"requiredInputs": {
			"weight": "bolder",
			"color": "attention",
			"size": "medium"
		},
		"optionalInputs": {
			"color": "good",
			"isSubtle": true,
			"weight": "lighter"
		}
	}
}
```

The full set of properties to be modified using full text formatting will be:

| Property | Default Value | Extra observations
| --- | --- | --- |
| `color` | `default` | |
| `isSubtle` | `false` | |
| `size` | `default` | | 
| `inputSpacing` | `default` | This should be the same for required and optional inputs |
| `weight` | `default` | |

Allowing the control of this styling via support of native styling on required and optional labels (i.e. CSS, Xaml Styles, etc) may also be required but will be set out of scope for v1 of this feature. This decision speaks to a larger discussion of the direction of host config that is beyond the scope of this document.

#### Required indicators

As has been mentioned in the Input.Validation spec, all input elements will support a new property called ```isRequired```. This property as its name implies, the input element will only be valid if some data has been inputted into it; to facilitate the users to discern whether an input is required or not we will render a "required" hint next to the labels for the required inputs. 

![img](assets/InputLabels/InputRequiredHint.PNG)

By default, we will mark required inputs with a `*`. We may want, however, to provide the option for the host to configure a suffix to the label for required or optional inputs. This allows the host to add a `*` to required labels, or to add the word "required". Consider a host config similar to the below:

```json
"inputs":
{
	"label": 
	{
		"requiredInputs": {
			"suffix": "*",
			"weight": "Bolder
		}
	}
}
```

### Card Author Formatting
We will prioritize Host formatting over card author formatting in order to allow our hosts to impose a specified look and feel to forms displayed in their app. That said, if we don't allow card authors to specify formatting of labels, those authors who wish to do so will simply opt-out of our label approach and revert to using the existing unassociated TextBlocks and RichTextBlocks. This has accessibility and usability impact on our end customers, as they won't have access to the improved experiences made possible when our renderers have semantic knowledge of which text blocks are the labels for a given input. On the other hand, based on responses from the survey, most card authors usually do not apply some special styling to TextBlocks used as labels, due to this reason, card author formatting will not be in the scope for v1 of this feature.

### Custom Rendering
To provide a little more flexibility and an experience that is as similar as possible across all platforms we will allow host apps to render their own labels using each platform's API. This will provide hosts more flexibility on how they will be able to render the labels.

As the current APIs we provide for custom rendering visual elements are made for Adaptive Cards elements they have a simple way to know what renderer they override by using the `type` defined in the json element, for labels we will propose the "type" name "`Label`" to avoid any confusions with other elements that have been already defined. 

## Backwards Compatibility
On earlier versions of renderers the label will be completely dropped, leading to a bad user experience. The card may be completely unusable if without the labels the user cannot deduce what information is meant to be provided in the unlabeled inputs.

Because the label is a property, not a new type, card authors will not be able to use type to trigger fallback to an independent text block and input. To support this, the card author would need to use requires as follows:

```json
{
	"type": "Input.Text",
	"id": "NameId",
	"label": "Please enter your name",
	"requires": {
		"adaptiveCards": "1.3"
	},
	"fallback": {
		"type": "Container",
		"items": [
			{
				"type": "TextBlock",
				"text": "Please enter your name:"
			},
			{
				"type": "Input.Text",
				"id": "NameId"
			}
		]
    }
}
```

We could also possibly add a specific named feature to the requires dictionary to allow card authors to address it directly using something like:
```json
"requires": {
	"inputLabels": "1.0"
}
```

Either of these approaches would allow card authors who know their cards will be hitting platforms targeting both 1.2 and 1.3 to take advantage of the labels for accessibility or interactivity purposes in 1.3 without breaking their experience on 1.2 clients. That this will not help card authors who are targeting 1.0 or 1.1 hosts where fallback is not supported. Card authors who know their hosts support version 1.3 (or any future version) will not need to worry about this concern.

## Placeholders

Based on the answers from Q7, no users answered to using placeholders only for labeling their inputs. We also got in touch with the Accessibility team which recommended us not to use labels as placeholders as that is detrimental for all people. For v1 of this feature we decided to not modify placeholders.

## Label Position

As alluded to above, we should consider how the label position is determined. One of the goals of this feature is to allow us to someday intelligently reflow inputs, so it may be the case that we want to maintain control of label positioning. Today we would always draw the label above the input, but in the future we may put it to the side if our rendering space is wide enough, or push it into placeholders if our space is constrained. For the time being, we can consider label position to be work for the future so it can line with intelligent reflowing but for v1 it's not going to be considered. 

## Other Input Types

This document has primarily focused on `Input.Text` in it's examples, but the label property should be present on all input types. See examples below:

### Date Input

``` json
{
	"type": "Input.Date",
	"id": "dateInput",
	"label": "Please enter the date:"
}
```
![img](assets/InputLabels/Input.Date.PNG)

### Time Input

``` json
{
	"type": "Input.Time",
	"id": "timeInput",
	"label": "Please enter the time:"
}
```
![img](assets/InputLabels/Input.Time.PNG)

### Number Input
``` json
{
	"type": "Input.Number",
	"id": "numberInput",
	"label": "How many would you like?"
}
```
![img](assets/InputLabels/Input.Number.PNG)

### Choice Set

#### Expanded

```json
{
	"type": "Input.ChoiceSet",
	"label": "Please select from the following options:"
	"choices": [
		{
			"title": "Choice 1",
			"value": "Choice 1"
		},
		{
			"title": "Choice 2",
			"value": "Choice 2"
		}
	],
	"style": "expanded"
}
```
![img](assets/InputLabels/Input.ChoiceSet.PNG)

#### Compact
```json
{
	"type": "Input.ChoiceSet",
	"label": "Please select from the following options:"
	"choices": [
		{
			"title": "Choice 1",
			"value": "Choice 1"
		},
		{
			"title": "Choice 2",
			"value": "Choice 2"
		}
	],
	"style": "compact"
}
```
![img](assets/InputLabels/Input.ChoiceSet.Compact.PNG)

### Toggle Inputs

```json
{
	"type": "Input.Toggle",
	"label": "Please accept the privacy policy:",
	"title": "I have reviewed and accept the terms of the privacy policy"
}
```
![img](assets/InputLabels/Input.Toggle.PNG)

## Feature Cost estimation

This feature focuses on adding a text element to an input element which will have to be implemented in all of our renderers and the designer. It's important to note that this feature covers the accessibility aspect which should be reviewed by people who have expertise in this aspect.

For the development of this feature (P0 & P1 tasks) the following costs have been estimated for all platforms like this:

| Task | Cost (days) | Previous requirements | Includes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| C++ Object Model | 4 | Spec completion | Tests |
| UWP Implementation | 4 | C++ Object Model | Tests and override sample |
| Android Implementation | 4 | C++ Object Model | Tests and override sample | 
| iOS Implementation | 4 | C++ Object Model | Override sample |
| C# Object Model | 4 | Spec completion | Tests |
| .NET Implemenation | 4 | C# Object Model | Override sample |
| HTML Implementation | 4 | C# Object Model | Tests | 
| JavaScript Implementation | 10 | Spec completion | Tests and Changes to designer |
| Bug Bash | 2 |  Spec completion, UWP, Android, iOS, Javascript and .NET implementations | Preparation and Bug Bash |
| Bug Fixing | 5 | Bug Bash | Bug fixing |
| Documentation | 6 | Spec completion, UWP, Android, iOS, Javascript and .NET implementations | Changes to schema explorer and guidance on how to override inputs | 
| Total cost | 51 | | |

Modifications to pipelines or other infrastructure changes are not required as this is a rendering (and accessibility) feature. The estimations were made considering that the developer(s) have experience with the platforms they are developing the feature in as well as their accessibility story.

It's also important to note that using the approach we went with, we must make sure our TextBlock and RichTextBlock rendering methods are open for consumption and are easy to use to any developer who has to override input rendering.

### Follow ups

As mentioned before, this feature tackles a big issue Adaptive Cards has with accessibility, as such, we'll need some guidance from the Accessibility Team at Microsoft to make sure the implementation we made was correct and provides a good experience for people using a screen reader application. I didn't account this in the total cost as this process may take anything from a day to multiple weeks and may fall in the category of bug fixing.

## Requirements Priorities

For v1 of this feature we will only release the requirements marked as P0, while P1 requirements will be left for a v2

| Priority | Task |
| --- | --- |
| P0 | isRequired support (rendering requirement hints) |
| P0 | Label support as a string |
| P0 | Accessibility support for inputs |
| P0 | Host can define formatting for labels in hostconfig |
| P0 | Labels still show up if an host overrides or custom renders an input |
| P0 | Renderers visually indicate what inputs are required (isRequired property) | 
| P1 | Hosts can define the string to be used as "required inputs" hint |
| P1 | Host Apps can define custom rendering for labels (using extensibility APIs) |
| P1 | Samples are provided for overriding input elements |
| P1 | Support for formating labels using other Adaptive cards elements |
| P1 | Support markdown in labels |

## Accessibility

The label property for inputs opens up a way where we can fix or help fix some parts of the accessibility story for forms rendered using Adaptive Cards. The guidelines we used were the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WDGA) 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) where we identified the following guidelines that could help guide our design and could help card authors to provide a better accessible experience using our product:

### 1.3.1 Info and Relationships

[Original guideline](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/content-structure-separation-programmatic.html)

Our design supports the use of a "required hint" which will allow cards to be standarized on what word or symbol the host application uses for marking a required input.

### 2.4.6 Headings and Labels

[Original guideline](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/navigation-mechanisms-descriptive.html)

This guideline will have to be taken care by card authors but by providing a simple way to specify label for input elements we hope to ease the design of input forms which in turn will make the labels to be more descriptive.

### 3.3.2 Labels and Instructions

[Original guideline](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/minimize-error-cues.html)

As part of this feature we'll support the vinculation of inputs with labels which in turn will allow inputs read the contents of the label they are linked with. Also, the rendering of labels will always be executed next to the input fields so people using screen magnifiers will be presented with minimal issues. 

# Appendix

## Survey results

### Q6. How would you expect a user to know the difference between required and optional inputs?

![img](assets/InputLabels/Survey1.png)

Most of the voters are fine with using an asterisk next to the inputs or labels. The options under other vary from card authors "thinking an asterisk is a bit crude" or adding the asterisk by themselves.

### Q7. How do you currently label your input fields?

![img](assets/InputLabels/Survey2.png)

Most of the voters use a text label and a placeholder for labeling their input text. The remaining voters only use a TextBlock on top of the input to label them. It's important to note that none of the voters only use placeholders for labeling.

### Q8. If you use a TextBlock to label your input, how frequently do you change the default TextBlock style? (size, weight, color, etc.)

![img](assets/InputLabels/Survey3.png)

Most of the voters "Rarely" change the default style for TextBlocks that label their inputs. A thing to note here is that no voter commented that they never style the TextBlocks.

### Q9. If you are a Host App that renders Adaptive Cards authored by others in your own app, how important to you is the ability to control the following?

![img](assets/InputLabels/Survey4.png)

This is the question where there's not a majority of voters who picked one option. People are very divisive on whether to have a reasonable default behavior and configuring the labels to keep consistency with other UI in their apps.  


 ## Comparisons to other platforms
For guidance, consider how labels and inputs are associated in XAML and HTML:

### XAML
#### Header
 Xaml TextBox has a “header” property, which is drawn above the text box. Clicking on the header puts focus in the TextBox. Narrator reads the header when the TextBox is selected.
Here is an example:

 ``` xml
 <TextBox Header="This is a header"/>
 ```

![img](assets/InputLabels/XamlHeader.png)


Or with a formatted header:
``` xml
<TextBox>
	<TextBox.Header>
    	<TextBlock  Text="Header" Foreground="red"></TextBlock>
	</TextBox.Header>
</TextBox>
```
![img](assets/InputLabels/XamlHeaderFormat.png)

Other control types such as Images can also be used as TextBox labels.

#### AutomationProperties
 Xaml also has an AutomationProperties.LabeledBy attached property for accessibility purposes. This property is used by all elements (not just inputs). If you use it to mark a proceeding text block as the label, it is read the same as a header by narrator, but does not have the click to select behavior of header. 

 ```xml
<TextBlock x:Name="inputLabel">This is a text block label</TextBlock>
<TextBox AutomationProperties.LabeledBy="{Binding ElementName=inputLabel}"/> 
```
 ![img](assets/InputLabels/XamlLabeledBy.png)

### HTML
#### Label
HTML has label tag which can be used to label inputs. The input can either be placed inside the label, or referenced with “for”:

``` HTML
  <label>
  Please enter your name:
  <input id="nameInput">
  </label>
```

Or
``` HTML
  <label for="nameInput"> Please enter your name:</label>
  <input id="nameInput">
```
 
This results in the label being associated with the input both for interactivity and accessibility.

#### Aria
 HTML also has aria-label and aria-labelledby. These properties are used for accessibility purposes. As in the Xaml AutomationProperties.LabeledBy property, this labels the input for accessibility purposes, but does not change the interactivity model: clicking on the label does not select the input.

 ## Accessibility Labels
Both Xaml and HTML have accessibility labels which can be used to address accessibility issues related to inputs (AutomationProperties and aria- properties respectively). In both cases, setting these properties addresses accessibility issues, but does not semantically associate the label with the input for interactivity behavior. Additionally, these properties are not input specific, and can be used on other elements as well as inputs. We should consider whether we want generic accessibility labels such as these, but such a feature should apply to all elements and is outside the scope of this document.

### Follow ups

As mentioned before, this feature tackles a big issue Adaptive Cards has with accessibility, as such, we'll need some guidance from the Accessibility Team at Microsoft to make sure the implementation we made was correct and provides a good experience for people using a screen reader application. I didn't account this in the total cost as this process may take anything from a day to multiple weeks and may fall in the category of bug fixing.

## Work for labels to be considered for a future iteration

Given that, we should consider options for card author label formatting. Consider the two following options.

### Card Author Formatting Options

As has been previously mentioned, the option for authors to format their cards will be retaken in the next version of this feature. This work will have to include the option of specifying markdown in your string labels as well as using other Adaptive Cards elements as a label which in turn will provide card authors richer experiences for rendering forms, while at the same time we will have to balance the freedom of card author formatting with the constraints of host formatting to provide a consistent experience within cards.

#### Option 1 – Allow TextBlocks and RichTextBlocks as Labels

One option would be to add support for TextBlock and/or RichTextBlock labels to add formatting support:

```json
{
	"type": "Input.Text",
	"id": "nameInput",
	"label": 
	{
		"type": "TextBlock",
		"text": "Please enter your name:",
		"weight": "Bolder",
		"color": "Good"
	},
	"placeholder": "Last, First"
}
```

The problem with this approach, however, is that if we allow the host to specify formatting, there could be a conflict between the formatting provided by the card author and that provided by the host. For example, if the card author makes all their labels bold, the host's indication that required labels should be bold will not provide any additional information, and the end user will not see any indication of which fields are required.

#### Option 2 – LabelFor Property on TextBlocks/RichTextBlocks
Another option would be to allow card authors who wish to format their labels to alternatively use a labelFor property on their TextBlocks instead of using the label property on Inputs. This would opt them out of host formatting, but still allow them to provide the association that would allow us to correctly mark the input for accessibility and interactivity:

``` json
{
	"type": "AdaptiveCard",
	"version": "1.0",
	"body": [
		{
			"type": "TextBlock",
			"text": "Please enter your name:",
			"weight": "Bolder",
			"labelFor": "nameInput"
		},
		{
			"type": "Input.Text",
			"id": "nameInput",
			"placeholder": "Last, First"
		}
	],
	"actions": [
		{
			"type": "Action.Submit",
			"title": "OK"
		}
	]
}
``` 

The downside of this is that it provides a less clean story to our card authors. They would now have two ways to specify a label, and without reading the documentation it would not be clear that one option results in host formatting being applied and the other doesn't. If, for example, a card author wants to emphasize a particular word, and uses a RichTextBlock to highlight that word, they might unknowingly opt themselves out of host formatting. 

#### More options on required indicators 
For following iterations of this feature, we may want to provide even more detailed control, we could allow the host to specify something like `{labelName} (required)` or `(required) {labelName}` in order to allow them to position their indicators as they wish. We could make use of the common expression language being used for templating to support this functionality, but that would require taking a dependency on the common expression language implementation that would not otherwise be required for hosts not using templating.

One concern with allowing hosts to specify arbitrary label templates or suffixes, is that it opens up a localization issue.  Whatever word they provide should be localized into the language of the card. If we introduce this functionality, we should make sure we have a localization story that covers this scenario.

### Label positioning
One of the goals of this feature is to allow us to someday intelligently reflow inputs, so it may be the case that we want to maintain control of label positioning. Today we would always draw the label above the input, but in the future we may put it to the side if our rendering space is wide enough, or push it into placeholders if our space is constrained.	

That said, it may be desirable let either the card author or the host configure the position of the label. The tradeoff is more layout power to the card author or host, and less flexibility to us to reflow in the future. Because of this, we will not introduce this with v1 of this feature, and consider it only if we get customer feedback or requests to allow positioning of labels.	

##### Label Above	
```json	
{	
	"type": "Input.Text",	
	"id": "nameInput",	
	"label": "Please enter your name:",	
	"labelPosition": "Above",	
	"placeholder": "Last, First"	
}	
```

##### Label to the Side	

```json	
{	
	"type": "Input.Text",	
	"id": "nameInput",	
	"label": "Please enter your name:",	
	"labelPosition": "Side",	
	"placeholder": "Last, First"	
}	
```

> Note on side positioning: With a form full of labels a card author likely would want the inputs to be lined up, which by default would not happen if the labels were different lengths. To properly support side labels we might need a way to group them so that all labels in a group are formatted consistently. Alternatively, we could consider whether we could devise an algorithm for lining up input labels.	
##### Label as Placeholder	

```json	
{	
	"type": "Input.Text",	
	"id": "nameInput",	
	"label": "Please enter your name",	
	"labelPosition": "Placeholder",	
	"placeholder": "Last, First"	
}	
```
